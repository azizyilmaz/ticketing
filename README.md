## About the Project
This project is a **high-concurrency ticket reservation system** built with **Spring Boot**.  
It is designed to handle **100k+ seats and 1M concurrent users**, ensuring **no double-selling of seats** under heavy load.  

It uses **pessimistic row locking (READ_COMMITTED)**, **short transactions**, and a **10-minute reservation hold** with a payment confirmation flow.  
The project also includes **AOP-based audit logging**, **exception handling**, and **concurrency tests**.

## Key Features
- **High-concurrency safe seat reservations** using pessimistic row locks  
- **10-minute reservation hold** before automatic expiry  
- **Payment confirmation flow** that atomically marks reservations as SOLD  
- **Audit logging with AOP**: every API call logged into DB  
- **Global exception handling** with meaningful error responses  
- **Scheduled cleanup job** for expired reservations  
- **Validation-ready DTOs** for input safety  
- **Concurrency and validation tests** included  

---

## Technologies Used
- **Java 17+**
- **Spring Boot 3.5.5**
- **Spring Data JPA** with pessimistic locking
- **Spring AOP** (audit logging)
- **Spring Validation**
- **Spring Scheduler** (cleanup job)
- **H2 Database** (dev/test)
- **JUnit 5 / Spring Boot Test**

## Project Architecture
- **Controller Layer (web/)** â†’ Handles REST API requests and responses  
- **Service Layer (service/)** â†’ Core business logic, transaction handling  
- **Repository Layer (repository/)** â†’ Database access with Spring Data JPA  
- **Entity Layer (entity/)** â†’ Maps database tables to Java objects  
- **Aspect Layer (aspect/)** â†’ Cross-cutting concern: audit logging  
- **Scheduler (scheduler/)** â†’ Periodically cleans expired reservations  
- **Exception Layer (exception/)** â†’ Centralized error handling

```

### Confirm Payment
```http
POST /api/reservations/confirm
```

### Get Seat Status
```http
GET /api/seats/{id}
```

## Layers and Responsibilities

- **Controller** â†’ API endpoints, request/response mapping  
- **Service** â†’ Business logic, reservation/payment handling, transactions  
- **Repository** â†’ Data persistence with pessimistic locks  
- **Entity** â†’ Maps domain model to DB tables  
- **Aspect** â†’ Logs API calls asynchronously for auditing
